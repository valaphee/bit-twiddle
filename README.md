Flow-based programming "language", the aim of this project is not to create an entry-friendly programming language, and more over<br>
to create a capable language, which is easy extensible and modular, and therefore allow this project to grow and gain as many<br>
integrations as possible.

The language itself should be intuitive, or simply not allow specific behavior which might be unlogical/hard to track, like for example<br>
mutable structures, without willingly activating it. (See list nodes, which are by default immutable and can be toggled to be mutable.)

This project consists of 6 parts:
* cran: Graph Specification
* cran-env: Environment
* cran-pkg-*: Specifications/implementations
* cran-meta: Node Metadata
* cran-spec: Node Specification
* cran-vis: JavaFX-based visual editor
